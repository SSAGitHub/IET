            <abstract>
                <p>Frequency error, non-ideal channel estimation (CE) and inefficient seamless road
                    side unit (RSU) service are critical issues occurring in conventional systems
                    that are completely specified by current IEEE 802.11p standards. This study
                    investigates novel techniques for achieving accurate frequency offset
                    compensation and effective CE and RSU selection for handover in
                    signal-overlapping areas. Recently, communications using data-aided orthogonal
                    frequency-division multiplexing (DA-OFDM), such as pseudo-random-postfix OFDM
                    and time-domain-synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM), have been actively studied because
                    of their higher effectiveness, efficiency and better transmission quality. This
                    study consists of three parts: (i) derivation of the maximum likelihood
                    estimation for DA-OFDM, (ii) design of an accurate RSU selection scheme and
                    (iii) implementation of a superior TD CE technique. Performance comparisons
                    between the conventional and the proposed techniques are conducted through
                    comprehensive computer simulations.</p>

                <title>Intelligent transportation system (ITS) history and its application</title>
                <p>ITS applications have generally been classified into three main categories in
                    terms of their functionalities: safety, efficiency and comfort/value-added
                    applications. These applications are well classified in [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="C1">1</xref>]. As the markets for telematics and the need for
                    safety-related applications have expanded significantly in recent years,
                    automotive electronics are becoming more and more important. Advanced wireless
                    communication technology actually grows momentum to ITS realisations.</p>
                <p>The most famous vehicular communication related projects around the world are
                    also described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C2">2</xref>]. Most of these
                    research projects are part of the vehicular <italic>ad-hoc</italic> network
                    (VANET). These research projects use conventional IEEE 802.11a systems to study
                    the emulation environments.</p>
                <p>The dedicated short range communication (DSRC) band occupies 75 MHz in the
                    5.850–5.925 GHz range. It was regulated by the Federal Communications Commission
                    (FCC) in the United States to improve traveller safety, decrease the possibility
                    of traffic congestion, to facilitate the reduction of air pollution and to help
                    conserve vital fossil fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C3">3</xref>]. The DSRC
                    communication modes can be divided into two types: vehicle to infrastructure
                    (V2I) and vehicle to vehicle (V2V). The entire DSRC spectrum is equally
                    partitioned into seven channels, each with a 10 MHz bandwidth. There are four
                    service channels (SCHs), one control channel (CCH) and two special-usage
                    channels. DSRC is capable of exchanging data at a high rate between either a
                    mobile or a stationary vehicle where an on-board unit (OBU) is located and
                    stationary road side units (RSUs) mounted on structures along roadways or
                    through hand-held devices.</p>

                <title>Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ITS system</title>
                <p>To date, the first standardised vehicular communication standard is IEEE 802.11p
                        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C4">4</xref>]. IEEE 802.11p forms the wireless
                    access standard in wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) in
                    conjunction with the IEEE 1609.x and is a new variant of the IEEE 802.11 family.
                    The IEEE 802.11p physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) layer
                    specifications are based on the IEEE 802.11a, and it is used as the framework
                    for DSRC to support inter-vehicle communication and ITS applications. In IEEE
                    802.11p, the SCHs, which are SCHs created for the purpose of avoiding or
                    mitigating vehicle accidents and are also capable of real-time multimedia
                    communications, operate at approximately 5.8 GHz. These ITS applications are
                    usually reserved for the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I/I2V) communication mode.
                    The parameters employed in the IEEE 802.11p are listed in Table <xref
                        ref-type="table" rid="TB1">1</xref>. The IEEE 802.11p adopts the same PHY as
                    the IEEE 802.11a, with the only exception being that a 10 MHz channel bandwidth
                    is used in IEEE 802.11p. The challenges faced by an IEEE 802.11p system include
                    wider coverage of operation, high-speed vehicles and extreme multipath
                    environments. WAVE/DSRC is described in great detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr"

                <p>Although IEEE 802.11p has already been standardised, there is no national-level
                    standard announced to follow it. Many researchers studies addressed how to
                    improve it or to propose new standards. In our previous field-trial research
                        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C6">6</xref>], packet loss is up to the level of
                    30% in high-speed V2I scenarios. Therefore a new system specification is highly
                    desired. On the other hand, the most recent trend is to support vehicular
                    communication networks with the assistance from mobile communication
                    networks.</p>

                <title>Issues and related works</title>
                <p>In general, vehicular communication is very similar to mobile/cellular
                    communication. The high-speed movement, large-scale service area and centralised
                    control system are common to both scenarios. The ultimate goal for both
                    mobile/cellular and vehicular communication is to build a large-scale service
                    environment. In these conditions, vehicular communication designers could learn
                    from the experiences of mobile communication designers. However, there are at
                    least three main differences between vehicular communications and
                    general-purpose mobile/cellular communications: for example, (i)
                    machine-to-machine communications; (ii) recursive and specific data transmission
                    (for a finite and small set of instructions); and (iii) requirements of
                    low-complexity and high-stability transceiving algorithms. During the literature
                    survey and analysis, two open issues were identified: the imperfect transceiver
                    design in the current standard and the inefficient handover procedure.</p>
                <p>The most comprehensive and complete standard for vehicular communication
                    currently is IEEE 802.11p. However, not only is the current IEEE 802.11p
                    inefficient at providing accurate channel estimation (CE) in a severely
                    frequency-selective fading environment because of insufficient pilot density,
                    but it also lacks rapid, effective PHY-layer handover schemes to help
                    soft-handover in high mobility.</p>
                <p>The transceiver design in the conventional IEEE 802.11p standard adopts a
                    comb-type pilot to prevent the fading channel. Although a comb-type pilot
                    arrangement can effectively combat fast fading effects, the pilot density in
                    IEEE 802.11p is definitely insufficient to perform accurate CE in environments
                    with long delay spreads. Therefore severe frequency selectivity becomes a
                    troublesome issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C7">7</xref>]. On a severely
                    multipath-faded channel, deep fades may occur between two neighbouring pilots.
                    Although linear interpolation is applied in the frequency domain, which is
                    considered to be the most popular method in an OFDM system, linear interpolation
                    cannot accurately filter the data subchannel weights from these distantly
                    separated pilots. Therefore the pilot density defined in the current IEEE
                    802.11p may be adequate in a line-of-sight (LOS) V2V scenario, but it is still
                    insufficient in rich-scattering V2I or I2V environments.</p>
                <p>To solve the pilot density insufficiency problem occurring in the current
                    standard and to figure out the direction of the future national or international
                    standard, several previous studies utilised midambles to assist the originally
                    employed preambles for enhancing CE performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C8"
                        >8</xref>]. In these studies, the midambles worked like block-type pilots,
                    which have previously been thoroughly investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="C8">8</xref>]. However, the use of midambles can improve CE, although
                    transmission throughput is sacrificed. Based on the above reasoning, effective
                    compensation for multipath effects is highly desired. To enhance CE performance
                    in an OFDM communication, the use of pseudo-random-postfix OFDM (PRP-OFDM)
                    communications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C9">9</xref>] and time-domain
                    synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) communications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C10"
                        >10</xref>], which arrange pseudo-random sequences into original guard
                    intervals, has been proposed. These data-aided OFDMs (DA-OFDMs) are practical
                    and also popularly employed in consumer products, such as in the Chinese digital
                    terrestrial multimedia broadcast system transmission standard [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C10">10</xref>]. Our prior work has also applied these
                    techniques to mobile OFDM communications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C11"
                        >11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C12">12</xref>]. All of these
                    previous studies employed pseudo-random sequences to perform TD CE. In addition,
                    a TD CE method has been investigated for the application of the PRP-OFDM
                    technique to the IEEE 802.11p applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C11"
                        >11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p>In contrast, TDS-OFDM technology is primarily applied in the digital broadcasting
                    applications. Therefore it usually occupies a much wider band and employs a long
                    training sequence (i.e. two PN sequences in self-prefix and postfix) to cascade
                    to the OFDM symbol prefix. Although this design works well on wireless digital
                    television broadcasting, these designs are definitely not suitable on a DSRC
                    band that is much narrower than the wireless digital television band. This is
                    the main reason why a vehicular communication-specific DA-OFDM has been
                    designed.</p>
                <p>The longer time required for currently existing handover procedures is another
                    drawback, which renders them extremely difficult to utilise in safety-related
                    applications. The IEEE 802.11a standard originally worked in an indoor
                    environment where no cellular structure exists; thus, most relevant handover
                    research is derived directly from conventional IEEE 802.11 techniques. The main
                    approach of these studies is based on mobile Internet protocol (mobile IP) or
                    cellular IP. However, mobile IP or cellular IP research is often aimed at data
                    transmission or multimedia communications. As a result, very few high-mobility
                    effects have been seriously considered. The handover procedure has been well
                    illustrated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C13">13</xref>]. Meanwhile, a
                    seamless communication service solution that can reduce the handover latency has
                    also been proposed. The simulation in this paper is based on the transceiver
                    works in an ideal condition, which can recognise the succeeding RSU
                    instantaneously during the handover procedure; likewise the synchronisation and
                    CE work perfectly.</p>
                <p>In practice, a handover procedure consists of the following three steps:
                    scanning, authentication and association. Most of the relevant research
                    regarding handover in vehicular communication scenarios focuses on upper-layer
                    authentication and association functions, such as [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C15">15</xref>]. Unlike in
                    mobile communications (e.g. third-generation partnership project (3GPP)
                    long-term evolution (LTE)-A or mobile WiMAX), no previous work considered sector
                    search (name derived from LTE-A), ranging (named from WiMAX) or handover
                    procedures on the PHY transmission layer of the IEEE 802.11. Therefore currently
                    rapid handover is still difficult to achieve. Apparently, rapid handover is
                    highly desired for current vehicular communications because they are built
                    according to IEEE 802.11 PHY.</p>
                <p>A convincing experimental testbed for the IEEE 802.11 handover was proposed
                    previously in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C15">15</xref>]. In this research, the
                    proposed handover method works on the MAC layer. The PHY scanning for a beacon
                    is only used for estimating the signal strength from candidate access points
                    surrounding the given mobile station (MS). Therefore in this scheme, the
                    pre-handover procedure cannot be conducted. Subsequently, pre-handover was shown
                    to function in the method proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C16"
                    >16</xref>]. However, this method also conducted handover on the upper
                    layers.</p>
                <p>In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C17">17</xref>], an MAC protocol improvement for
                    video streaming applications over VANETs is described. The RSU network topology
                    of the simulation scenario is not continuous. If the PHY handover (especially
                    soft-handover) technique is good enough, the application of the MAC protocol can
                    be extended, improving the performance. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C18"
                        >18</xref>], a large-scale VANET scenario has been discussed. Several ideas
                    in MAC that are addressed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C18">18</xref>], such
                    as time synchronisation and decreasing the packet collisions, can be used to
                    complement the proposed method in this paper. Moreover, Wu and Weng [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C14">14</xref>] proposed a new idea in which MS can
                    obtain the RSUs location information with assistance from global positioning
                    service (GPS) systems. The MS can begin to process the pre-handover at the
                    pre-setup positions.</p>
                <p>In view of the above concerns, the IEEE 802.11p frame structure has to be
                    modified very slightly to significantly improve the PHY handover effectiveness
                    of the IEEE 802.11p for the primary purpose of achieving a sufficiently rapid
                    handover.</p>
                <p>To solve the rapid handover and pre-handover issues, a somewhat classic research
                    topic, synchronisation must be taken into account herein. In the current IEEE
                    802.11p standard, a short preamble can synchronise the receiving symbols through
                    a series of training sequences. The synchronisation techniques used in
                    communication systems have been developed for decades. One of the most useful
                    and accurate methods for estimating timing and frequency offsets is the
                    maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). van de Beek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C19">19</xref>] proposed an efficient
                    maximum-likelihood (ML) joint estimator of timing and frequency offsets by using
                    a cyclic prefix (CP) in the data-frame. In general, a residual timing offset
                    within the inter-symbol interference (ISI)-free range does not influence or
                    degrade the system performance, but a frequency offset does. Therefore adequate
                    timing synchronisation is easy to achieve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C19"
                        >19</xref>]. The positioning techniques, such as the time-of-arrival method,
                    require precise synchronisation between the transmitter and the receiver. In
                    contrast, the RSU selection can also support vehicle localisation. In [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C21"
                        >21</xref>], the vehicle location management methods have been addressed.
                    However, these methods require knowledge of high-level packet data or GPS
                    information. The RSU selection method proposed in this paper can help the OBU
                    obtain location information from a few cooperative RSUs.</p>

                <title>Contribution</title>
                <p>In this paper, a practical IEEE 802.11p-like vehicular DA-OFDM transceiver
                    architecture is proposed and thoroughly studied. This novel OFDM architecture
                    for vehicular communication can accomplish better performance in synchronisation
                    and CE than conventional CP OFDM systems. A modified ML estimation method that
                    can use be applied on DA-OFDM has been addressed. Besides, a TD CE method that
                    can work well in the overlap area is studied thoroughly, and a complete
                    transceiver with the assistance from the proposed TD CE is verified in this
                    paper. In addition, a novel, efficient PHY RSU selection scheme is proposed and
                    thoroughly investigated in this paper. The proposed PHY RSU selection is based
                    on the handover concepts employed in cellular communications in order to support
                    high mobility. The proposed RSU selection can achieve remarkable improvements on
                    a predictive handover mechanism, and it allows the OBUs to recognise which RSUs
                    could provide satisfactory services.</p>
                <p>These benefits will improve the transceiver performance, and stable transmission
                    and faster handover and location services can also be realised based on the
                    proposed techniques. In data transmission in high-speed trains [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C22">22</xref>], for example, the PHY improvement in
                    this paper can enhance the MAC algorithm proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="C22">22</xref>]. Tunnel safety communication, radio data system-traffic
                    message channel (RDS-TMC) and real-time vehicle/driver monitoring are some
                    examples of the possible applications. Moreover, cellular-vehicle communication
                    is a very important future research topic that can be studied based on the
                    achievements presented in this paper.</p>
                <p>Section 2 of this paper briefly describes the operating scenario and system
                    structure under scrutiny. In Section 3, the proposed RSU selection and
                    synchronisation methods are explained. In Section 4, comparative computer
                    simulations of IEEE 802.11p communications are presented. Finally, relevant
                    comparisons and concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.</p>

                <title>RSU topology</title>
                <p>The RSU topology adopted here is the mesh topology, which is illustrated in Fig.
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Usually, a wireless band is
                    partitioned into many channels, which are then exclusively allocated to
                    individual cells such that each cell does not own channels whose spectra do not
                    overlap with those of any other cell. The co-channel interference during sector
                    search in a cellular network can therefore be assumed to be negligible.
                    Unfortunately, an RSU could occasionally occupy the same channel band,
                    particularly in a metropolitan setting with complex transportation systems, thus
                    causing overcrowding of the radio spectra. WAVE service advertisement (WSA)
                    works to provide the notifications of the services the RSU serves and what
                    SCH(s) they are provided on (MAC layer) to users. Therefore WSAs from two
                    neighbour RSUs are quite similar. To prevent mutual interference between two
                    RSUs, time-division duplex is a well-developed idea that can be used to solve
                    this problem. Meanwhile, the WSA is not the only message being sent in the CCH;
                    there are several different control signals being sent after periodic WSAs. From
                    this sequence, each WSA transmission interleaves with a WSA period, as shown in
                    Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref><italic>a</italic>, to satisfy most
                    conditions. However, in some special conditions in which the street patterns are
                    complex, more time slots are needed to separate the signals from different RSUs,
                    as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref><italic>b</italic>. <fig

                        >23</xref>], different training sequences have been adopted to improve the
                    CE performance. In fact, there are many good training sequence candidates that
                    have good correction properties. In this paper, the Gold-sequence is adopted
                    because it is popular and well known. Therefore each RSU employs a specific
                    Gold-sequence as the prefix when the symbols are transmitted. The sequence is
                    assigned according to Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB2">2</xref>. The
                    Gold-sequence has similar properties to the PN-sequence, and it can aid in RSU
                    selection and handover, as mentioned in the previous section. <table-wrap

                <title>RSU selection and handover</title>
                <p>High-mobility must be inherently taken into consideration for mobile
                    communications but not for wireless local area networks (WLANs), for example,
                    IEEE 802.11 a/b/g, for which, the common PHY is also exploited in IEEE 802.11p
                    for vehicular communications. When IEEE 802.11p operates in the outdoor
                    environment, the RSU selection and the handover must become significantly
                    crucial issues as the result of high mobility and multiple RSUs, which were not
                    taken into consideration for a WLAN. A usual handover process often consists of
                    three steps: scanning, authentication and association. After the scanning
                    process is completed by a MS or a vehicle, three sets of identification codes
                    should be classified. They are called the active set, the candidate set and the
                    neighbour (or monitored) set. The active set is also the service providing set
                    at the current time. Signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is often an effective
                    indicator that is exploited for handover decisions, cell reselections and a few
                    other PHY procedures and is therefore used as a coverage indicator for a given
                    cell. SIR can be represented as
                        <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>, where
                        <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub> is the energy contained in one chip of the
                    signal and <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> is the total effective interference
                    with interference power spectrum density in the band. If
                        <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> of any signal
                    from other RSUs is detected higher than that required for serving as an
                    effective ID code in the active set, the RSU will be classified to be a
                    candidate set. If the
                        <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> of any signal
                    from other RSUs is lower than the required value set for serving as an ID code
                    in the active set, the corresponding RSUs will be classified as a neighbour
                    set.</p>
                <p>In 3GPP LTE specifications, when user equipment (UE) moves between two cells,
                    backward or predictive handover is used. In this type of handover, the source
                    cell determines the target cell based on the measurement report and then, it
                    queries the target cell whether it owns sufficient resources to serve the UE.
                    Meanwhile, the target cell begins to prepare radio resources before the source
                    cell handovers the UE to the target cell itself. As in mobile communications,
                    the WAVE network also has a similar design. The CCH broadcasts WSA messages
                    periodically and broadcasts urgent short messages occasionally. Therefore the
                    OBU may receive WSA messages from different RSUs at the same time. When the OBU
                    separates the received mixed signals, it can identify the WSA message with the
                    highest power as being from the current RSU and the one with the second highest
                    power as being from a candidate RSU. This procedure is called RSU selection.</p>
                <p>Although an OBU has a current candidate RSU, the data flow is transmitted via the
                    SCHs. Simultaneously, the CCH is still transmitting WSA messages periodically
                    and transmitting urgent short messages occasionally. Meanwhile, synchronisation,
                    CE and equalisation are conducted in order to reduce channel impairments. When
                    the OBU enters a common area belonging to two serving RSUs, the handover
                    procedure is processed successively. Handover information is currently packed
                    into WSA message packets from the RSU to the OBU. This conventional arrangement
                    means that an OBU cannot process an active handover or pre-synchronise to a
                    successive RSU. Fortunately, if the DA-OFDM proposed here is employed with the
                    assistance from training sequences arranged as symbol prefixes, the OBU can
                    easily adopt these different training sequences to conduct active handover or
                    pre-synchronisation.</p>

                <p>A DA-OFDM transceiver architecture is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig"

                    The optional signal mapping schemes, such as binary phase-shift keying (BPSK),
                    quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16-QAM, and 64-QAM, are utilised in the
                    transmission unit.

                    symbols are inserted onto the given subcarriers for CE, which are located on the
                    − 21st, − 7th, 7th and 21st subcarriers. <fig id="F2" orientation="portrait"

                <p>In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the symbol structure is depicted
                    in detail. The preamble employed in the proposed technique is the same as that
                    in the current IEEE 802.11p standard. Short preambles are used for time
                    synchronisation and coarse CE. Long preambles are used for fine CE. It is thus
                    assumed that the initial channel state can be estimated well after the
                    preambles. However, the channel state may change with time. Therefore each
                    symbol has to update the channel state and compensate for a timing and frequency
                    offset iteratively on time. The transceiver design proposed in this paper will
                    focus on synchronisation and CE on a symbol-by-symbol basis. The symbols after
                    the preamble are a data symbol stream. The guard interval (GI) in the data
                    symbol stream that is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> is
                    designed to prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI). Usually, the GI in the data
                    symbol stream is inserted in a CP; however, in DA-OFDM, training sequences
                            <bold><italic>p</italic></bold><italic><sub>L</sub></italic> are
                    inserted as the prefix of each OFDM symbol. The Gold-sequence serves both as the
                    RSU ID code and as the pre-synchronisation sequence, and it is assigned as shown
                    in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB2">2</xref>. <fig id="F3"

                <p>This will be described in further detail in the following section. At the
                    receiving end, after the carrier frequency and the timing offset
                    synchronisation, the compensated signal is estimated to determine the channel
                    condition and to enable the equaliser to succeed. Then, the prefix is removed
                    and the signal is fed into the block demodulator based on discrete Fourier
                    transform (DFT).</p>
                <p>As mentioned in the first section, the impact of channel interference on vehicle
                    communications fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably. As a result, the fading
                    channel is referred to as a rapidly time-varying channel. Path loss is a
                    large-scale fading, which comes from the strength of the radio signal getting
                    weak. Path loss and shadowing effects are typically dealt with by automatic
                    power control or diversity techniques. A propagation conveying LOS is often
                    modelled as a Rician distribution, whereas a non-LOS is often modelled as a
                    Rayleigh distribution model. In addition, the system performance evaluation in
                    this paper adopts a small-scale fading model that was measured and characterised
                    by the IEEE 802.11 working group at the Georgia Institute of Technology [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C24">24</xref>]. The environmental parameters used in
                    this paper are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">3</xref>. Of
                    course, these small-scale fading models can be used to represent multipath
                    fading effects but do not include path loss or shadowing effects. <table-wrap

                <title>Synchronisation</title>
                <p>In the current IEEE 802.11p standard, the timing offset can be estimated by
                    transmitting a series of training sequences in a short preamble. By several
                    conventional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C19">19</xref>, <xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="C25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C26"
                        >26</xref>], the timing offset can be recovered well. In fact, in the OFDM
                    system, a time offset usually cannot significantly change the received signal
                    quality if the right timing instant still falls in the ISI-free region.
                    Inherently, a carrier frequency offset (CFO) leads to inter-carrier interference
                    (ICI) and it can thus significantly degrade performance on signal detection.</p>
                <p>The CFO in the OFDM system not only attenuates the amplitude of the receiving
                    signal but also leads to ICI, which can destroy the orthogonality of the
                    subcarriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C26">26</xref>]. van de Beek <italic>et
                        al</italic>. also proposed a useful ML estimation method for
                    synchronisation. The conventional Beek's method uses the tail data to process ML
                    algorithm with CP. However, the DA-OFDM has no embedded CP. DA-OFDM is also
                    different with TDS-OFDM. Unlike TDS-OFDM, DA-OFDM cannot use its long training
                    sequence being inserted in the prefix to process synchronisation. In this
                    circumstance, the modified Beekôs ML estimation is proposed. In this method, a
                    redundancy buffer is needed. Although the proposed method needs more memory than
                    the conventional standard, the remarkable improvement on performance is
                    worth.</p>
                <p>Based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C19">19</xref>], the modified MLE
                    formulation for DA-OFDM could be formulated as follows: the prefix of the

                <title>Channel estimation</title>
                <p>Specified in the current IEEE 802.11p standard, four pilots are allocated in an
                    OFDM block and they are exploited for the sake of CE. The four pilots are
                    retained in the proposed technique. Thus, conventional CE methods (e.g. linear
                    interpolation) must still be used. Sometimes, a conventional CE method will
                    adopt a channel tracking method to enhance performance. The channel tracking
                    method proposed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C27">27</xref>] used the
                    FD channel state information which was estimated in the preamble to be the
                    reference states and uses pilots to measure the difference between the on-time
                    channel states and the reference states. The reference states can then be
                    modified to match the on-time channel states. This scheme could reduce the
                    inaccuracy of linear interpolation.</p>
                <p>The proposed CE method is based on our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C12">12</xref>]. The main
                    idea of our proposed method is TD CE, which is used to analyse the received

                    and the data stream vector

                    As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>L</italic> is

                <title>RSU selection</title>
                <p>The DA-OFDM can be adopted to enhance rapid RSU identification (ID). The
                    Gold-sequence inserted in the prefix also works as RSU ID; then, by detecting
                    and analysing the receiving symbols, the OBU can scan all candidate RSUs in an
                    overlapped area. This procedure is similar to cell/sector search in
                    mobile/cellular communications, such as LTE-A or WiMAX-2. In this paper, we
                    focus on how an OBU can use a training sequence to determine which RSU is the
                    main service provider and which RSU is the most likely candidate to be the next
                    service provider. This particular RSU candidate scanning procedure can be called
                    RSU selection. Once an OBU confirms the following RSU, the OBU can also realise
                    its location, then use the information to update the information which is
                    generated from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="C21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, when a vehicle enters
                    into an overlapping area, it will sense a signal that is a combination of the
                    signals coming from RSU 1 and RSU 2. Point <italic>A</italic> is the threshold
                    at which the signal strength can be detected by the OBU. Point
                        <italic>B</italic> is the action point to start handover. As a result, the
                    RSU selection should be completed between points <italic>A</italic> and
                        <italic>B</italic>. <fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float">

                    </fig></p>
                <p>The RSU selection method is first addressed in this paper and has not been
                    applied to vehicular communication networks yet. Therefore we have to evaluate
                    the probability of a false decision for this new scheme. The decision scheme is
                    described as follows:</p>
                <p>First, the synchronisation procedure is assumed to be well processed. Then, the
                    OBU will buffer a WSA packet with several data symbols.</p>
                <p>Second, <italic>n</italic> symbols are cumulated and normalised to be a reference
                    symbol unit. This procedure results in noise reduction. This procedure is
                    repeated to obtain <italic>k</italic> reference symbol units.</p>
                <p>Finally, based on Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, there might be
                    three candidate RSUs that use different RSU IDs. After the MLE procedure, three
                    different values of <italic>γ<sub>k</sub></italic> will be obtained. By ordering
                    these estimates of <italic>γ<sub>k</sub></italic>, the most probable sequence
                    adopted by the successive RSUs can be realised. Obviously, more accuracy could
                    be obtained for <italic>k</italic> values greater than unity.</p>
                <p>The RSU selection algorithm is described by the pseudocode in Algorithm 1 (see
                    Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). <fig id="F6"

            <p>Three simulations were conducted and presented in this paper: the probability of a

                another. Moreover, there are three possible target service areas that are controlled
                by three different RSUs. These three RSUs all broadcast their own signal. The
                simulation scenario for synchronisation and CE involves testing the performance of
                the transceiver. In this scenario, the OBU transceiver will receive symbol streams
                from the RSU.</p>
            <p>During RSU selection, the procedure will accumulate <italic>n</italic> symbols,
                normalise them to be a reference symbol unit and use reference symbol units to
                determine the candidate RSU. Therefore the evaluation metric is the probability of a
                false decision for different <italic>n</italic> and <italic>k</italic>;
                    <italic>n</italic> = 10 and <italic>k</italic> = 1, 4. The path loss model
                adopted for this simulation is a log-normal distributed model.</p>
            <p>For synchronisation, the frequency offset was set in this simulation at 20 ppm of the
                carrier frequency. The evaluation metric was the mean-square error (MSE). The
                synchronisation techniques compared in this paper are the conventional MLE method,
                which was proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C19">19</xref>], and our proposed
                method. In the conventional MLE method, the CP was used to obtain the phase shift.
                In our proposed method, the DA prefix was used to estimate the phase shift.</p>
            <p>For the comparison of CE techniques, this paper compared the BER performances of the
                conventional CP-OFDM and the proposed technique using different signal-to-noise
                ratio (SNRs) under the same channel conditions. The modulation type was QPSK and the
                packet length was two preambles (a short preamble and long preamble) with either 25
                data symbols. The speeds and environments tested in the paper were 120 km/h to
                represent urban and rural environments and 140 km/h to represent the expressway
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="C24">24</xref>]. All simulations were transmitted
                for 10 s. The CE techniques compared in this paper were conventional methods using a
                pilot with linear interpolation. The proposed method will use our proposed TD LS CE
                technique. Simultaneously, the CE performance in the overlap area was also
                evaluated. Assuming that the overlap area between two RSUs is 1 m long, we observe
                the CE performance from the point a vehicle enters the overlap area to the handover
                point. Within this area, the OBU in the vehicle receives signals from both RSUs. In
                this simulation, the path loss is defined using a log-distance model, and the two
                RSUs transmit interactively.</p>
            <p>Shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> are the rates of false decisions
                on different SNR values. It can be observed that the performance of the proposed RSU
                selection was evaluated. Lower rates of false decisions will help the OBU catch the
                following RSU with improved accuracy. The OBU can also synchronise the following RSU
                signal before a handover, which enables a soft-handover. Even at very low SNRs, the
                false decision probability was still lower than 10<sup>− 2</sup>. If the reference
                symbol units <italic>k</italic> is increased from 1 to 4, the improvement in
                performance will also be higher. This is because the channel condition is sometimes
                really severe for a short period, while multiple time decisions are used to avoid an
                occasional misjudgment. <fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float">

            <p> Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> shows the MSEs obtained using the
                proposed technique and conventional technique compared here. It was observed that
                the proposed method resulted in a remarkable improvement. Compared with the
                conventional MLE, the MSEs showed that the proposed method had more than a 40–50%
                improvement in synchronisation. This improvement results from the inclusion of
                training sequences in the DA-OFDM which is better than the use of CPs. This result
                also proves that the DA-OFDM is a practical architecture for vehicular communication
                networks. In addition, the proposed MLE and conventional MLE are actually similar,
                and therefore it enables the existing transceiver unit to adapt easily to the new
                design. <fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float">

            <p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, comparisons of CE techniques
                also suggest that the proposed method can recover a rapidly fluctuating fading
                channel. Furthermore, the proposed method is approximately 30% better than the
                conventional methods. Based on the previous three simulation results, we believe
                that the proposed transceiver can be one of the strong candidates in next-generation
                vehicular communication systems, especially because it confirms that the proposed
                technique can afford safety-related ITS applications. <fig id="F9"

                conventional and the proposed method in the overlap area. The effective transmission
                status of the proposed method is more stable than that of the conventional method.
                Developing a more stable transmission condition during the handover process is a
                basic requirement for approaching seamless transmission. Although the proposed
                method requires more memory than the conventional standard to buffer the training
                sequence, the remarkable improvement in performance is worth the cost. The
                performance was benchmarked with the MATLAB tic-toc method, and multiple simulation
                times were averaged to minimise statistical deviations. The proposed DA-OFDM will
                increase the computation time by 0.85% over the conventional CP-OFDM. <fig id="F10"

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>This paper proposed a practical DA-OFDM transceiver for vehicular communications. In
                addition, a new RSU selection technique was studied. An overall design of the
                transceiver structure, which can be adopted in current IEEE 802.11p specifications,
                was investigated. The proposed technique assisted from the Gold-sequence as a prefix
                exhibits more precise estimations and therefore can achieve lower error
                probabilities. This paper is focused on transceiving techniques, and so all the
                simulations are based on one vehicle to one RSU and one vehicle to multiple RSUs.
                The multi-vehicle and large data simulation should be adopted as the simulation
                scenario for real and practical applications. In our survey, RDS-TMC is a good
                simulation scenario. The advantages of the proposed technique have been verified by
                means of extensive computer simulations.</p>
