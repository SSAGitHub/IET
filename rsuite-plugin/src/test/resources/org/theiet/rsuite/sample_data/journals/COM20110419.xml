                <p>Broadcasting is a key component of several networking mechanisms in mobile
                        <italic>ad hoc</italic> networks. However, its traditional implementation
                    suffers from resource consumption caused by message redundancy. Several
                    efficient algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Among them, the
                    class of algorithms that construct on-demand a connected dominating set, known
                    as dominant pruning, yields an improved performance. Dominant pruning algorithms
                    capitalise on neighbourhood information and the previous hop of the broadcast
                    message in order to minimise the set of nodes that forward a message. The
                    proposed algorithm makes the observation that all the nodes, visited by a
                    broadcast message, may be exploited in order to minimise the cost of
                    broadcasting. The analysis of the proposed algorithm as well as extensive
                    simulation results confirm the rationale behind the proposed approach and prove
                    the performance gains.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Nowadays the use of wireless mobile <italic>ad hoc</italic> networks (MANETs) for
                supporting temporary communication needs has been spread in various application
                scenarios. However, protocols used in wired networks cannot be ported in wireless
                networks due to mobility and the nature of wireless transmission. In wired networks,
                topology remains constant whereas in wireless mobile networks nodes can move to any
                direction producing topology variations. As a result, communication is hard or even
                impossible to be established. Many wireless networking protocols use broadcasting
                for adapting to topology variations. For example, many routing [<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C1">1</xref>] and multicast [<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C2">2</xref>] algorithms use network layer
                broadcasting in order to discover a new route or send a route invalidation message.
                Therefore a cost-effective broadcasting mechanism is required. Flooding is the most
                popular technique for reliable broadcasting because of its simple implementation.
                However, a study of pure flooding brought to surface the broadcast storm problem
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C3">3</xref>] and made clear that the
                limited bandwidth and energy resources necessitate the design of efficient
                communication protocols.</p>
            <p>Several research groups have dealt with efficient broadcasting. The proposed
                algorithms can be classified into three categories: (a) heuristic, (b) cluster-based
                and (c) minimum connected dominating set (CDS) approximations. The objective of all
                schemes is to eliminate redundant transmissions by minimising the set of nodes that
                forward packets. Heuristic schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C3"
                    >3</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C9">9</xref>] utilise
                probabilistic parameters that depend mainly on topology-based criteria in order to
                determine the nodes allowed to forward packets. The drawback of heuristic algorithms
                is the difficulty in fine-tuning the probabilistic parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C10">10</xref>] in order to guarantee message delivery even to
                poorly connected networks. In cluster-based schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C11">11</xref>], broadcasting is performed by cluster heads and
                gateway nodes. More specifically, cluster heads are responsible for delivering
                packets inside clusters, whereas gateways propagate packets between clusters.
                However, in this approach, cluster heads and gateways become points of congestion.
                As a result, cluster-based broadcasting may not fit with some applications. For
                example, when flooding is used as part of an on-demand routing protocol, congestion
                points should be avoided. Furthermore, clusters are susceptible to mobility;
                therefore their maintenance induces increased cost.</p>
            <p>Another approach is to use a CDS for broadcasting [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C12">12</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C25"
                    >25</xref>]. The idea is to permit only nodes that belong to the CDS to forward
                packets. The objective is to reduce the size of the calculated CDS in order to
                achieve optimal transmission overhead. The CDS may be constructed on a proactive
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C12">12</xref>&ndash;<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C18"
                    >18</xref>] or reactive (on-demand) fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C19">19</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C23"
                    >23</xref>] or may be based on global positioning satellite (GPS) information
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C25">25</xref>]. Hybrid approaches that combine heuristic and
                CDS-based approaches have also been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C26">26</xref>]. Recent works include CDS-based approaches that
                incorporate network-coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C27">27</xref>]
                and directional antennas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C28">28</xref>]. In
                this paper, we focus on the subclass of algorithms that construct a CDS on an
                on-demand basis, known as dominant pruning (DP). This class of algorithms has been
                identified to provide a flexible and low overhead solution [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C29">29</xref>]. In DP, each node <italic>v</italic>, receiving
                a broadcast message from node <italic>u</italic>, determines a CDS valid for its
                2-hop neighbourhood by electing 1-hop neighbours that are allowed to forward the
                message. The election is carried out by a pruning process that exploits the
                neighbourhood of nodes <italic>v</italic> and <italic>u</italic> in order to
                minimise the calculated CDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C20">20</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C21">21</xref>]. The approach is based on
                the observation that the neighbours of <italic>u</italic> should not be considered
                because they have already received the message.</p>
            <p>Although the DP approach has been proved to be effective, using only the
                neighbourhood of the previous hop node clearly provides an underestimation of the
                nodes that have already received the message. Providing a better estimation should
                result in performance improvement. In this paper, we make the observation that the
                set of nodes visited by a message in its travel from the source node to a node
                    <italic>v</italic> provides a good basis for estimating the nodes that have
                already received this message. Therefore the set of these nodes may be utilised by
                the pruning process in order to minimise the constructed CDS. The proposed
                algorithm, called history-based 2-hop dominant pruning (H2DP), exploits the
                neighbourhood of each node visited by a broadcast message in order to ameliorate
                broadcasting. We provide an analysis of H2DP that justifies our approach while an
                extensive simulation study confirms its improved performance compared to total
                dominant pruning (TDP), partial dominant pruning (PDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C21">21</xref>] and DP [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="COM20110419C20">20</xref>] protocols, which are the most representative of
                the DP category and yield the best performance. Finally, we propose an optimisation
                of H2DP, called history-based dominant pruning (HDP), which is tailored for sparse
                and highly mobile networks.</p>
            <p>The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we provide useful
                notation and briefly describe DP. Then, in Section 3, H2DP is delineated while its
                complexity analysis is presented and discussed. In Section 4, we describe the model
                used in the simulation study, while in Section 5 simulation results are presented
                and discussed. The optimisation of H2DP for sparse highly mobile networks is
                presented in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 useful conclusions are drawn.</p>

            <p>H2DP falls into the category of DP algorithms. Therefore before delineating its
                operation, we formulate the problem of DP. To this end, the following notation is
                employed: <list list-type="bullet">

                                <italic>u</italic> itself, and is called the 1-hop neighbourhood of
                                <italic>u</italic>.</p></list-item>
                    <list-item><p><italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)) denotes
                            the 2-hop neighbourhood of node <italic>u</italic>, that is, the set of
                            nodes that lie within two hops from node <italic>u</italic>. Clearly,
                                <italic>N</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)&sube;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)).</p></list-item>
                </list></p>
            <p>In DP, each node <italic>v</italic> maintains knowledge about
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)) by exchanging with
                its neighbours periodic hello messages that contain 1-hop neighbourhood information.
                In order to forward a broadcast message, node <italic>v</italic> calculates a subset
                of <italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>), called the forwarding set, and piggybacks
                it on the message. <list list-type="order">

            <p>In DP&apos;s approach, <italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) is a CDS of the graph
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)), therefore all nodes
                in <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)) will receive the
                message after it is forwarded by all nodes in
                <italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>v</italic>). Each node
                    <italic>w</italic>&isin;<italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>v</italic>), after receiving
                the message, repeats the procedure. The CDS for the entire network consists of the
                forwarding sets computed locally by each node. The algorithm terminates either when
                    <italic>w</italic>&notin;<italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) or when node
                    <italic>w</italic>&isin;<italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) but a
                termination criterion is met. Two termination criteria have been proposed [<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C21">21</xref>], namely relayed&sol;unrelayed
                and marked&sol;unmarked. The latter specifies that node <italic>w</italic> should
                not forward the message if all nodes in <italic>N</italic>(<italic>w</italic>) have
                already received it, whereas the former mandates that node <italic>w</italic>
                forwards a message only once. In this paper we will focus on the
                relayed&sol;unrelayed criterion since it provides a low-cost implementation compared
                to the marked&sol;unmarked criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C21"

                is a well-known polynomial time algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr"

                    >31</xref>] that adopts a greedy approach in order to provide an approximation
                of the optimal solution. Although all DP algorithms adopt GSC, they take a different

            <p>H2DP falls into the category of algorithms that construct on-demand an approximation
                of a minimum CDS by utilising the DP approach. Moreover, H2DP introduces the concept
                of packet history. Let us consider the case that a packet <italic>p</italic> is
                received by a node <italic>v</italic> after being transmitted by node
                    <italic>u</italic>. The term packet is used to refer to a copy of a broadcast
                message. However, in some parts the terms packet and message are used
                interchangeably. The packet history consists of the nodes that have already received
                    <italic>p</italic>. More specifically, the history

            </statement>
            <p>According to H2DP&apos;s approach, reducing the size of the universal set
                    <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) holds a central role in minimising the
                number of elected forwarding nodes and therefore in alleviating the cost of
                broadcasting. To this end, H2DP makes the observation that
                    <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) may contain nodes that have already
                received <italic>p</italic> (i.e. they belong to the packet&apos;s history),
                therefore such nodes may be eliminated from <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>).
                More specifically, upon reception of <italic>p</italic> coming from node
                    <italic>u</italic>, <italic>v</italic> examines the forwarding list
                    <italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) which is piggybacked on
                    <italic>p</italic>&apos;s header. If
                    <italic>v</italic>&notin;<italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) then the packet
                is discarded. Otherwise, <italic>v</italic> calculates
                    <italic>B</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)&equals;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)&minus;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)

                </disp-formula> and constructs <italic>Fw</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) by utilising
                GSC. In the special case that <italic>v</italic> is the source node
                    <italic>s</italic>,
                    <italic>B</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)&equals;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)
                and
                    <italic>U</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)&equals;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)).
                Determining the nodes in packet history is clearly very important for the
                performance of H2DP. The simplest approach is to consider only the nodes in
                    <italic>P</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>), that is,
                    <italic>H</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>)&equals;<italic>P</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>).
                This approach has been proposed in the literature of non-dominant pruning schemes
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C32">32</xref>] on the basis that only
                those nodes are proved to have received <italic>p</italic>. However, this approach
                provides an underestimation of the nodes that have actually received the packet and
                has a negligible impact on reducing <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) since
                usually
                    &verbar;<italic>P</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>)&verbar;&equals;&verbar;<italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)&verbar;.
                On the other hand, H2DP makes the observation that each node <italic>w</italic> in
                    <italic>P</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>) is a
                forwarding node. Therefore all nodes in
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>w</italic>)) have been scheduled
                to receive the packet by the execution of the algorithm at <italic>w</italic>.
                Consequently, in H2DP <disp-formula id="COM20110419M2">

                    <italic>v</italic> makes the assumption that, given a node

                all nodes in <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>w</italic>)) have
                received packet <italic>p</italic>. This is the same assumption as the one made by

                    rid="COM20110419F1">1</xref><italic>b</italic>). However, H2DP results in a

            <p>All DP algorithms, including H2DP, rely on GSC to implement the forwarder selection

            <title>Representation of packet history and neighbourhood information</title>
            <p>The method used for representing the packet history is a key performance factor of
                H2DP. The reason is twofold. On the one hand, the history size affects the packet
                size. The simulation study presented in the following confirms that even if a raw
                representation method is used (i.e. each node is represented by its address), H2DP
                produces packets of reasonable size even for large networks. However, reducing the
                packet size is a challenging objective, which should be combined with the
                alleviation of computational overheads related to operations on the packet history
                and&sol;or the universal set such as search, addition and deletion. Equations (<xref
                    ref-type="disp-formula" rid="COM20110419M1">1</xref>)&ndash;(<xref
                    ref-type="disp-formula" rid="COM20110419M3">3</xref>) indicate that a node is
                frequently involved in such operations. For example, suppose that a node
                    <italic>v</italic> receives a packet <italic>p</italic> from node
                    <italic>u</italic>. The calculation of <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)
                involves searching whether each node
                    <italic>w</italic>&isin;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>))
                is a member of <italic>H</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>).
                Such computational overheads also exist in all other DP schemes but have never been
                addressed.</p>
            <p>It is clear that a more elaborate representation method for packet history and
                possibly for neighbourhood information should provide size minimisation as well as
                fast search, addition and deletion operations. To this end, we propose the use of
                bit arrays or bit vectors. Bit arrays are the simplest way to implement direct
                addressing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C30">30</xref>] in which
                dictionary operations are executed in <italic>O</italic>(1) time. In our
                implementation, a bit vector of size <italic>S</italic> may be used to represent a
                set of <italic>S</italic> nodes. A bit set to 1 indicates that a node is a member of
                the set. The network addressing scheme, for example, IP addressing, may be used to
                provide one-to-one mapping of node addresses to bit vector indexes. This mapping can
                be predefined if all possible members of the set are known. It is clear that all
                network nodes may be members of a packet history. Therefore in order to use bit
                vectors, the size of the vector <italic>S</italic> should be equal to the maximum
                network size, that is, <italic>S</italic>&equals;<italic>N</italic>. This results in
                a requirement of <italic>N</italic> bits for a network of <italic>N</italic> nodes.
                For a 200-node network, the required history size is 25 bytes which is rather small;
                only a set of six nodes could be represented with the same amount of bytes if IP
                addressing is assumed and the whole address is stored. Therefore bit arrays may also
                provide efficient compression of packet history.</p>

                <p>The performance of H2DP is assessed through comparison with TDP, PDP and DP
                    algorithms which are known to yield the best performance in the DP class of
                    algorithms. In broadcast algorithms, like those investigated in this paper,
                    simulating realistic network conditions is of great importance. This is because
                    packets are transmitted through MAC layer broadcasts, therefore packet
                    collisions result in packet drops. Collisions also have an impact on hello
                    messages and therefore affect the accuracy of the neighbourhood information.
                    Furthermore, congestion may also result in packet losses and&sol;or delay. In
                    this work, we used the medium access control of IEEE 802.11, provided in the CMU
                    extension of ns2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C33">33</xref>], in
                    order to approximate realistic network conditions. Moreover, we used
                    configurations of high mobility in order to assess the resilience of the
                    algorithms to stale neighbourhood information. All presented results were
                    obtained as average values over 20 independent simulation runs. The simulation
                    time for each run was 900&emsp14;s. The confidence level for all reported
                    results is 95&percnt;. The simulation parameters are summarised in

                <p>The network consists of <italic>N</italic> nodes that roam in a square area. The

                    while the nominal bitrate is set to 2&emsp14;Mb&sol;s. Mobility scenarios have
                    been produced using the well-known random waypoint (RW) algorithm and the
                    perfect simulation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COM20110419C34">34</xref>]
                    in order to avoid transient artefacts in nodes&rsquo; movement. We consider a
                    &lsquo;sparse&rsquo; and a &lsquo;dense&rsquo; network topology. The
                    &lsquo;sparse&rsquo; topology corresponds to a low-density network in which a
                    node has only one neighbour in the worst case while the average number of
                    neighbours is 15. On the other hand, in the &lsquo;dense&rsquo; network topology
                    the node density is twice the density of the &lsquo;sparse&rsquo; topology, that
                    is, the average number of neighbours is 30. In order to control the node density
                    and produce &lsquo;sparse&rsquo; and &lsquo;dense&rsquo; topologies, we used
                    square roaming areas of different size depending on the number of nodes
                        <italic>N</italic>. The actual size of the roaming area is derived through
                    the node distribution proposed for the RW algorithm in [<xref ref-type="bibr"

                <p>Each node maintains 2-hop neighbourhood information by periodically exchanging

                        <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> seconds. A neighbour is
                    removed if a hello message has not been received within
                            2<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> seconds since the last
                    update. An important issue related to broadcast schemes is the jittering
                    required for avoiding collisions of duplicate packets [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="COM20110419C29">29</xref>]. In order to have a fair comparison of all
                    algorithms, we chose a random jittering scheme with the maximum jitter set to
                    0.1&emsp14;s. Regarding history representation, the optimisation presented in
                    Section 3.2 has not been used in order to capture the worst-case performance of
                    H2DP. Instead, we used 4&emsp14;bytes for representing a node in the forwarding
                    set or in the packet history. This size is sufficient for storing addresses even
                    if an IP-based addressing scheme is considered.</p>

            <title>Simulation study and analysis</title>
            <p>In the first experiment, we evaluate the performance of H2DP against the network size
                in dense and sparse networks under low mobility (1&emsp14;m&sol;s) and traffic load
                (0.2&emsp14;pkts&sol;s). Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F2">2</xref>
                illustrates the number of forward nodes, that is, the average number of nodes that
                forward a broadcast message, for all the investigated algorithms. H2DP outperforms
                all other schemes for all network sizes in both the dense and the sparse topologies.
                H2DP&apos;s performance in small networks (less than 75 nodes) is almost equivalent
                to that of TDP (and PDP), especially in the case of dense networks. The reason is
                that most nodes are within two hops from the source node <italic>s</italic>. As a
                result, H2DP works mainly in the first hop, therefore the history of a packet
                    <italic>p</italic> at a node
                    <italic>v</italic>&isin;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) consists only of
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)), that is,
                    <italic>H</italic><sup><italic>s</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>)&equiv;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)).
                In this case, according to (1), the operation of H2DP is identical to that of TDP
                and close to the operation of PDP. When the network size increases, many nodes are
                located more than one hop away from <italic>s</italic>, that is, a route
                    <italic>P</italic><sup><italic>v</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>) to a node
                    <italic>v</italic> contains more hops on average. Therefore according to (2),
                the packet history is populated by more nodes. Consequently,
                    <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) is effectively reduced and the
                approximation factor of GSC improves (see (7)), resulting in reduced forwarding
                sets. On the other hand, the improvement of TDP and PDP compared to DP is smaller
                than that of H2DP and remains approximately the same for all network sizes. This can
                be ascribed to the strategy of both algorithms to only take advantage of the
                previous hop <italic>u</italic> in order to minimise the universal set at node
                    <italic>v</italic> (TDP only uses
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)) whereas PDP utilises
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)&cap;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>u</italic>))).
                This strategy cannot take advantage of the longer paths that a packet travels as the
                network size increases. TDP reduces forward nodes by &sim;22&percnt; compared to DP;
                PDP improves by &sim;14&percnt; whereas H2DP manages a gain up to &sim;46&percnt;.
                The improvement compared to DP is less intense for all schemes in the sparse
                topology (&sim;26, &sim;14 and &sim;10&percnt; for H2DP, TDP and PDP, respectively)
                due to the reduced neighbourhood size.</p>

            <p>It must be noted that the tradeoff for the improvement witnessed in TDP, PDP and H2DP
                with respect to DP is the increased computational and space requirements due to the
                extensive use of 2-hop neighbourhood information. However, the representation method
                proposed in Section 3.2 may be used in order to effectively alleviate the space as
                well as the computational requirements related to the use of 2-hop
                neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F3">3</xref> depicts the delivery
                ratio, that is, the percentage of network nodes that receive a broadcast message.
                This metric is of great importance in contention-based and mobile networks. All
                schemes present a high delivery ratio near to 100&percnt; for small dense networks
                    (Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F3">3</xref><italic>a</italic>).
                However, in large dense networks there is a rapid performance degradation because of
                congestion and packet collisions. Since the packet generation rate is relatively low
                (only 0.2&emsp14;pkts&sol;s), congestion is the result of packet redundancy produced
                by the algorithms. This is confirmed by Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig"
                    rid="COM20110419F4">4</xref> where the packets received per node, that is, the
                average number of duplicate packets of a broadcast message received by a node, is
                illustrated. Indeed, more duplicate packets are produced for large dense networks
                since there are more forwarding nodes (Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig"
                    rid="COM20110419F2">2</xref><italic>a</italic>) and more disjoint paths through
                which packet duplicates may reach a node. In small networks, both H2DP and TDP
                achieve better delivery ratio compared to DP since both protocols minimise
                congestion. On the contrary, in large networks TDP fails to reduce congestion to the
                same extent as H2DP does (Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F5"
                    >5</xref>). The same applies to DP and PDP; however, their increased packet
                redundancy compensates for packet losses due to congestion and results in a slower
                degradation of the delivery ratio compared to TDP. However, this is not enough to
                outperform H2DP which effectively reduces network load even for large networks and
                achieves the highest delivery ratio. Similar performance characteristics are
                witnessed for sparse networks. However, differences are smoothed out since the
                reduced connectivity induces less congestion for all schemes. Finally, concerning
                    Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F4">4</xref>, we should point out
                that packet redundancy is related to the node&apos;s energy consumption since packet
                reception and processing involves an energy cost. Consequently, Fig.&nbsp;<xref

                illustrates mean delay, that is, the average delay involved in receiving a broadcast
                message, which is another important performance metric. In dense networks, H2DP
                induces smaller delays by minimising the number of duplicate packets. This
                minimisation has a twofold impact; on the one hand alleviates congestion and
                therefore smaller queuing delays occur, while on the other hand medium access delay
                is minimised as a result of less contention. The increasing trend of delay with
                respect to network size is ascribed to the increasing number of hops involved in a
                broadcast. As a result, longer delays are evident in sparse networks where paths
                consist of more hops due to the reduced connectivity. In this case, the performance
                of all schemes is similar since delay is dominated by the number of hops.</p>
            <p>Finally, in Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F5"
                    >5</xref><italic>b</italic> we present the normalised byte overhead, that is,
                the average number of bytes transmitted in the network during the broadcast of a
                message. This metric evaluates the impact of piggybacking the history on the
                packet&apos;s header. Surprisingly, H2DP induces less bytes in the dense topology
                scenario while its performance is close to the other schemes in sparse networks.
                Bear in mind that the presented results represent the worst-case scenario for H2DP
                since the optimisation for packet history representation, proposed in Section 3.2,
                has not been used. Instead, we used 4&emsp14;bytes for each address piggybacked on
                the packet&apos;s header. The significantly reduced number of transmissions
                    (Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F2">2</xref>) justifies
                H2DP&apos;s performance. Although packets of more bytes are created, the overall
                balance is positive. It should be pointed out that, in contention-based networks,
                the bandwidth is consumed by the access delay which is dominant compared to the
                transmission delay. Keeping in mind that access delay depends on the number of
                packet transmissions and transmission delay depends on the packet size, it is clear
                that minimising the number of transmissions has a greater impact on bandwidth
                savings.</p>

                <p>It is important for schemes that use neighbourhood information, such as DP, to
                    evaluate their resilience to high mobility. Therefore in this section, we will

                            >6</xref><italic>a</italic> the delivery ratio for all algorithms is
                        presented against node mobility for sparse and dense networks. In sparse
                        networks, mobility severely affects all algorithms since neighbourhood
                        information quickly becomes stale. The impact of mobility is greater in TDP
                        and H2DP. More specifically, although H2DP is superior to DP (by
                        &sim;0.4&percnt;) when mobility is low, its performance lacks
                        &sim;0.4&percnt; when mobility is 20&emsp14;m&sol;s. Similar performance is
                        witnessed for TDP. This behaviour is ascribed to the fact that 2-hop
                        neighbourhood information, which has an increased invalidation rate compared
                        to 1-hop neighbourhood, is used to minimise
                            <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>). However, in dense networks, H2DP
                        preserves its advantage over all algorithms through the entire mobility
                        range. In this case, although the neighbourhood information is invalidated,
                        the increased node connectivity provides multiple paths (path diversity)
                        that enable all algorithms to efficiently deliver the broadcast message.
                        These results indicate that algorithms utilising 2-hop neighbourhood may
                        become less efficient in sparse networks of increased mobility
                        (&gt;20&emsp14;m&sol;s) such as VANETs. In Section 6, we propose an
                        optimised version of H2DP that presents increased resilience to
                        mobility.</p>

                    <title>Impact of hello interval</title>
                    <p>The impact of mobility depends on the refresh rate of neighbourhood
                        information, that is, the hello interval. A short hello interval provides
                        the means for dealing with performance degradation in highly mobile
                        networks. In Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F5"
                            >5</xref><italic>b</italic>, the delivery ratio is presented against the
                        hello interval for all algorithms in networks of high mobility
                        (20&emsp14;m&sol;s). As expected, long hello intervals cause degradation in
                        performance of all schemes; however, the impact is more intense on H2DP and
                        TDP because 2-hop neighbourhood is used. Again, the impact of hello interval
                        is heavier in sparse networks because of the reduced path diversity. Shorter
                        hello intervals are in favour of H2DP in both dense and sparse networks.
                        Although all schemes improve their performance, due to more accurate
                        neighbourhood information, the improvement in H2DP is sharper, since it is
                        combined with reduced levels of congestion due to the minimisation of
                        elected forwarding nodes. On the other hand, all other schemes produce more
                        transmissions therefore part of their improvement is nullified by increased
                        levels of collisions. This is evident in a more clear way in the case of
                        dense networks where congestion is heavier than in sparse networks. In this
                        case, only H2DP improves its performance for hello intervals of
                        1&ndash;2&emsp14;s. On the contrary, all other schemes do not improve due to
                        congestion. Finally, when the hello interval is 0.5&emsp14;s (there will be
                        more hello messages and therefore more collisions), the performance of all
                        schemes is degraded. It is worth mentioning that the congestion in DP is so
                        high that shorter hello intervals have the opposite effect, that is,
                        reduction in delivery ratio. According to the presented results, it is clear
                        that H2DP may utilise shorter hello intervals in sparse and highly mobile
                        environments in order to improve its performance in terms of delivery ratio.
                        The cost of using a shorter hello interval may be compensated by the reduced
                        packet redundancy witnessed in Figs.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig"

                <title>Performance under congestion</title>
                <p>In this section we evaluate the performance under conditions of increased
                    congestion. Such conditions are frequently present in MANETs due to the limited
                    bandwidth. In Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F7">7</xref>, the
                    performance of all algorithms is presented against the broadcast rate. As
                    expected, all schemes are heavily affected. As far as the delivery ratio is
                    concerned (Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F7"
                        >7</xref><italic>a</italic>), DP rapidly collapses, especially in dense
                    networks since the increased network connectivity aggravates congestion. H2DP
                    produces less duplicate packets and therefore is able to cope with congestion
                    more effectively. As a result, H2DP achieves an improvement of &sim;3.5&percnt;
                    in the sparse and &sim;6.5&percnt; in the dense network compared to TDP, which
                    is the second performer. The improvement compared to DP reaches up to
                    &sim;13.5&percnt; in the dense network and &sim;6&percnt; in the sparse. A
                    confirmation of congestion is the mean delay, presented in Fig.&nbsp;<xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F7">7</xref><italic>b</italic>. When
                    broadcast rate is above 1&emsp14;pkt&sol;s, delay rapidly increases because
                    longer queues are formed and frequent activity in the medium increases access
                    delay. When the network is heavily congested (2&emsp14;pkt&sol;s) only H2DP
                    achieves an acceptable delay (&sim;160&emsp14;ms) and at the same time exhibits
                    the best delivery ratio (Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F7"

            <title>History-based DP</title>
            <p>The performance evaluation of H2DP has brought to light its reduced resilience to
                highly mobile (&gt;20&emsp14;m&sol;s) and sparse networks. This behaviour stems from
                the fact that H2DP, when building
                    <italic>H</italic><sup><italic>v</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>) in node
                    <italic>v</italic>, makes the optimistic assumption that every node in
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)) has already or will
                receive <italic>p</italic>. However, stale neighbourhood information, which is
                frequent in highly mobile environments, may invalidate the aforementioned
                assumption. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose to use only
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) in forming the packet history, that is
                    <disp-formula id="COM20110419M10">

                </disp-formula></p>
            <p>The intuition is that resilience to mobility will be increased since
                    <italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) has a smaller invalidation rate compared
                to <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic>(<italic>v</italic>)). We call the resulting
                DP scheme, HDP. HDP takes a more conservative approach compared to H2DP. It only
                makes the assumption that all nodes in <italic>N</italic>(<italic>w</italic>),
                    &forall;<italic>w</italic>&isin;<italic>H</italic><sup><italic>v</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic>)
                have already received <italic>p</italic>. Clearly, the approach of HDP is to
                tradeoff reduction of forward nodes for delivery efficiency. This can also be
                verified by (2), (10) and (7); the history of HDP is smaller than that of H2DP;
                therefore <italic>U</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) is bigger in HDP. As a result, the
                approximation factor is worse than that of H2DP.</p>

                carried out in sparse networks. HDP is compared with H2DP and DP, which presents the
                best resilience to highly mobile and sparse networks. The approach of HDP is proved
                to be effective since it outperforms DP with respect to delivery ratio even for the
                highest mobility. Moreover, this is accomplished in parallel to a reduction of the
                number of forward nodes that ranges in &sim;13.5&ndash;15.5&percnt; for all mobility
                levels. This result confirms the tradeoff that HDP introduces, since its performance
                lies between that of DP and H2DP. The resilience of HDP to mobility is also
                confirmed by Fig.&nbsp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COM20110419F8"
                    >8</xref><italic>b</italic>, where the impact of hello interval is illustrated.
                Even for long intervals HDP preserves its superiority over both DP and H2DP. At the
                same time, even though HDP produces more forward nodes compared to H2DP, it still
                manages an impressive reduction that reaches up to 18.5&percnt; compared to DP.</p>

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>In this paper a new approach to DP, called H2DP, has been proposed for minimising the
                redundant transmissions during broadcasting. H2DP makes the observation that the
                history of a packet may be used for minimising the set of forwarding nodes in
                DP-based schemes. The analysis of H2DP as well as its extensive simulation study
                have confirmed its improved performance compared to existing DP schemes with respect
                not only to the minimisation of broadcasting cost but also to the ability to deliver
                a broadcast message. Furthermore, an optimisation of H2DP, tailored for highly
                mobile and sparse networks, has been proposed and proved to be effective in
                increasing the resilience to mobility.</p>
