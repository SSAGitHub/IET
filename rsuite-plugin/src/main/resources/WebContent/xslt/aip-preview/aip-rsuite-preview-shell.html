         <p>This book treats the theory and practice of temperature measurement and control and
            important related topics such as energy management and air pollution.  There are no
            specific prerequisites for the book although a knowledge of elementary control theory
            could be useful.  The first half of the book is an application oriented survey of
            temperature measurement techniques and devices.  The second half is concerned mainly
            with temperature control in both simple and complex situations.
         </p>
         <p>The book reviews developments in the following areas: temperature measurement; thermocouple;
            resistance thermometer; thermistors; radiation thermometry; temperature sensors; industrial
            temperature measurement problem; heat sources; temperature control and energy conservation.

         <p>The underlying absolute thermodynamic temperature scale measured in degrees Kelvin
            is approximated for practical purposes by a degree Celsius scale that is defined with
            the aid of fixed points, interpolating instruments and interpolating functions. It
            is interesting to note that the relation οC = οK-273.15 is only approximately valid, with highest accuracy in general at the primary
            fixed points.

         <p>Suppose that two wires composed of different materials A and B are twisted together
            at their ends to form a closed loop as in Fig. 3.1. Then if the two junctions are
            at different temperatures θι, θι, it is found that a thermally generated EMF, dependent
            only on the compositions of the two wires and on θι - θχ, is acting in the loop. Provided
            that the wires are of accurately known composition, the generated EMF may be used
            as a measure of temperature difference between the twisted junctions.

         <p>The electrical resistance of almost every material varies with temperature. The resistance
            of metal conductors generally increases with temperature in a repeatable manner, but
            at a low sensitivity. Measuring sensors exploiting this phenomenon to measure temperature
            are called resistance thermometers. The resistance of semiconductor materials with
            temperature varies in a more complex manner usually, but not always, resistance falls
            with rising temperature. Certain semiconductor materials have a very high rate of
            change of resistance with temperature, making them very attractive for use as temperature
            sensors if problems such as stability and device-to-device variability can be overcome.
            Temperature sensors based on resistance changes in semiconductor materials are called
            thermistors. In general, resistance thermometers find application in situations demanding
            high accuracy. Thermistors are applied where high sensor output and low cost are required.

         <p>Hot objects above a temperature of about 500°C emit visible light, but by far the
            greater proportion of radiation is emitted in the infra-red part of the spectrum.
            Even at ordinary temperatures near ambient, the emission of infra red radiation is
            sufficient to form a basis for accurate measurement by radiation techniques.

         <p>The availability of low-cost small size integrated circuits allows temperature information
            to be selectively extracted from signals produced by such phenomena. In this way many
            'new' types of temperature sensors may be constructed. New development in temperature
            sensor helps to produce robust low-cost small-size sensors for inclusion in consumer
            devices. Extremely accurate calibration standards are produced. Devices that measure
            mean temperature (rather than spot temperatures) in a spatial region are needed. Robust
            miniature sensors that can be used to measure temperatures in applications where currently
            available sensors are not applicable is developed.

         <p>Many application-dependent problems arise because of the physical configuration of
            a particular process. Some commonly arising features that need non-routine consideration
            are: (i) The surface temperature of a solid (perhaps a solid that is in rapid motion)
            needs to be measured, (ii) The average temperature in a region needs to be measured
            accurately, (iii) The temperature of a moving gas needs to be measured, (iv) The internal
            temperature within an impenetrable massive solid needs to be measured.

         <p>The book presents the list possible sources of heat produced the following: (i) exothermic
            reaction, (ii) release of latent heat during change of state, (iii) release of heat
            during pressure changes in a gas, (iv) mechanical friction, (v) electrical I2R heating, (vi) electrical heating due to alternating magnetisation, (vii) electrical
            heating due to alternating electrification, (viii) electrical heating due to thermoelectric
            effects, (ix) thermonuclear heating. For the purposes of this practically oriented
            book we move to the following derived set of readily applicable heat sources: (a)
            combustion, from (i), (b) heat pumps, from (ii) and (iii), (c) electrical resistance
            heating, from (v), (d) induction heating, from (v) and (vi), (e) microwave heating,
            from (vii), (f) electric arc heating, from (v), (g) infra-red heating, from (v). Combustion
            is clearly in practice the most important of the available sources of heat, and therefore
            we devote considerable space to this topic.

         <p>On-off closed-loop temperature control will often yield results that are quite adequate
            for industrial applications. Using the methods explained, an approximate process model
            may be derived from simple tests. The model may then be used to predict approximate
            values for the period and amplitude of the oscillation of temperature under closed-loop
            control, together with an estimate of the relation of this oscillation to desired
            temperature, θd. In cases where the amplitude of oscillation is too great for the
            given accuracy specification, suggestions are made for the inclusion of a phase-advance
            element in the control loop with the aim of reducing the amplitude of oscillation.
            Although an on-off temperature control loop may be simple in terms of hardware, it
            is a nonlinear loop and as such its rigorous analysis is quite difficult and approximate
            methods will usually be used. The chief attraction of on-off control is the usually
            low cost of the associated actuators.

         <p>A closed loop system is required to meet a specification that is made up of three
            parts: (a) A speed of response requirement (b) An accuracy requirement (c) A stability
            margin requirement. Speed of response is often conveniently characterised by closed-loop
            bandwidth ωb and the nature of the transient response by the parameter M = maxω|(y(ω)/v(ω)|. The accuracy requirement is usually stated in terms of steady state
            error in response to a particular input such as a step input, ramp input or parabolic
            input.

         <p>In many heating processes, it will be the aim to remove the product (corresponding
            to the cube) once the centre temperature in the product has reached a specified uniformity.
            Calculation of the temperature distribution requires a knowledge of heat transfer
            rates that is normally difficult to obtain to a sufficient degree of accuracy. Calculation
            of the temperature distribution requires a knowledge of heat transfer rates that is
            normally difficult to obtain to a sufficient degree of accuracy.

            is discussed. It also discusses interlinking of furnace-pressure control with combustion-air
            control, simple temperature control of a stirred tank and control of regenerators.

         <p>The advantages of using a commercially available temperature controller will be ease
            of application and low cost. The chief disadvantage will usually be the difficulty
            of integrating and harmonising the temperature-control loop into a larger scheme.A
            typical basic specification for a low-level temperature controller is: (a) Input designed
            to receive Chromel/Alumel or other popular base-metal thermocouple signal with in-built
            correction for the non-linearity of the specified thermocouple. (b) Cold junction
            compensation. (c) Thermocouple break-protection (system switches off power on thermo
            couple becoming open-circuit). (d) On-off or PID algorithm specified by purchaser
            or sometimes both are provided. (e) High-low low-temperature alarms. (/) Solid-state
            relay available to drive electrical loads or other on-off actuators.

         <p>To achieve efficient acceptable temperature control in a large building, despite seasonal,
            diurnal and random changes in external climates, and to provide for a complex occupancy
            pattern is a very difficult problem. An ideal control system for a large office building
            would be highly flexible, allowing individual adjustment by small groups of people
            engaged in similar tasks. In the longer term, a combination of energy-conscious managements
            and low-cost control hardware can be expected to make comprehensive temperature control
            in large buildings commonplace.

         <p>The initial discussion of the topic of energy conservation in Shinskey (1978) would
            be difficult to improve upon and the approach below follows his line of reasoning
            closely. The energy is an isolated system is constant, but energy can exist in different
            forms. Although the world is not an isolated system it is clearly incorrect to say
            that the world's energy is being used up: rather it is being converted into a low-level
            unusable form. It is the world's fuel resource that is being used up. Temperature
            difference is the essential driving force of engines or of heating and cooling devices.
            Hot air is useful for winter heating and cold air is useful for summer cooling, but
            a mixture of hot and cold air at the same temperature as the environment has no value
            from a useful energy point of view. As a further example, consider the Atlantic Ocean.
            It contains a vast quantity of heat energy that cannot be extracted (unless a lower-temperature
            'sink' can be found at a deeper level in the ocean or can be provided by some other
            means such as towing an iceberg southwards). Temperature differences can be exploited
            to drive useful processes or they can be squandered by irreversible mixing without
            any useful work being extracted.

         <p>Anyone proposing to work on the measurement and control of thermal processes will
            probably have some knowledge of the theoretical foundations of thermal phenomena.
            The rapid review that follows is intended to set out the salient features of theory
            that govern system behaviour. There are many excel lent texts (a few are quoted in
            the list of references, Section A. 19) covering thermodynamic fundamentals at different
            levels and from different viewpoints.
