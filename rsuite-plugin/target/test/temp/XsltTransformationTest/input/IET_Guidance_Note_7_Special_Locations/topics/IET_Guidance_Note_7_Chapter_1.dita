          <p><xref format="dita" href="../Wiring_Regulations/IET_Wiring_Regulation_Cha_41.dita#r411.3.3" scope="external">Regulation 701.411.3.3</xref> now requires that additional protection
            shall be provided for all circuits of the location, by the use of one or more RCDs
            having the characteristics specified in Regulation 415.1.1. This is a significant
            change. Previously, only fixed currentusing equipment (other than electric showers)
            located in zone 1 and current-using equipment (other than fixed current-using equipment
            such as a washing machine, if suitable for use in a bathroom, connected through a fused
            connection unit) located in zone 3 required 30 mA RCD protection. The updated <xref format="dita" href="../Wiring_Regulations/IET_Wiring_Regulation_Cha_41.dita#r411.3.3" scope="external">Regulation 701.411.3.3</xref> means that all circuits, including
            lighting, electric showers, heated towel rails, etc., will require 30 mA RCD protection.
            Zone 3 has now been removed.</p>

          <p>Regulation 415.1.1 specifies the use of RCDs
            with a rated residual operating current (I<sub>Δn</sub>) not exceeding 30 mA and an
            operating time not exceeding 40 ms at a residual current of 5 I<sub>Δn</sub>.</p>

          <p>Another significant change is introduced by Regulation 701.512.3. This now permits 230 V socket-outlets to be installed in
            a room containing a bath or shower provided that they are installed at least 3 m
            horizontally from the boundary of zone 1. This change removes the ambiguity that existed
            previously between locations containing a bath or shower and a bedroom containing a
            shower.</p>

          <p>Regulation 701.415.2 introduces a further significant change regarding supplementary
            equipotential bonding. The regulation states that where the location containing a bath
            or shower is in a building with a protective equipotential bonding system in accordance
            with <xref format="dita" href="../Wiring_Regulations/IET_Wiring_Regulation_Cha_41.dita#r411.3.1.2" scope="external">Regulation 411.3.1.2,</xref> supplementary equipotential bonding may be
            omitted, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled.</p>

        <p>The particular requirements of Section 701 apply
          to locations containing a fixed bath (bath tub, birthing pool) or shower and to the
          surrounding zones as described in the regulations. The requirements do not apply to
          emergency facilities in industrial areas or laboratories, on the presumption that they
          will only be used in an emergency. Where they are used with any regularity the
          requirements of the section would apply.</p>

        requirements are necessary for bathrooms and other wet locations.</p>
      <p>See <xref format="dita" href="#division-1.5" scope="external">Section 5</xref> for prevention of conductive
        electric shock.</p>
      <p>Persons in bathrooms are particularly at risk due to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>lack of clothing, particularly footwear</li>
        <li>presence of water reducing contact resistance</li>
        <li>immersion in water, reducing total body resistance</li>
        <li>ready availability of earthed metalwork</li>
        <li>increased contact area.</li>

        <p>Clothing, particularly footwear such as shoes or boots, can greatly increase the total
          body resistance.</p>

        <title><d4pSimpleEnumerator name="d4pSimpleEnumerator">1.3.2</d4pSimpleEnumerator> Body impedance</title>
        <p>IEC publication DD IEC/TS 60479-1 <i>Effects of current on human beings and livestock</i>
          provides information on body impedance. Body impedance varies from person to person. The
          value of impedance depends on a number of factors, in particular on current path, touch
          voltage, duration of current flow, frequency, degree of moisture of the skin, surface area
          of contact, pressure exerted and temperature. The IEC document provides information on
          different total body impedances hand-to-hand for small, medium and large surface areas of
          contact in dry, water-wet and saltwaterwet conditions. For bathrooms and showers, Table
          1.1 shows the varying total body impedance for a current path hand-to-hand, for large
          surface areas (10000 mm<sup>2</sup>) in contact with dry and water-wet conditions for
          different touch voltages. Large surface areas of contact have the lowest impedances, with
          medium surface area contact (1000 mm<sup>2</sup>) and small surface areas of contact (100
            mm<sup>2</sup>) having impedances of progressively higher magnitudes.</p>

      <section>
        <title><d4pSimpleEnumerator name="d4pSimpleEnumerator">1.3.3</d4pSimpleEnumerator> Immersion</title>
        <p>Immersion of a body in bath water produces large areas of contact of water and as Table
          1.1 shows, this will reduce the total body impedance.</p>
        <p>This reduction in body impedance coupled with a location that has earthed metalwork from
          pipes etc. makes a bathroom particularly hazardous and therefore require special
          precautions to be taken.</p>

        <p>Zones 0, 1 and 2 provide a very practical method of specifying requirements for
          protection of equipment against the ingress of water and protection against electric
          shock, etc. in a specific and unambiguous way. Equipment is either in a zone or outside a
          zone and this can be determined by measurement.</p>

        <p>Figures 1.1a, b and g show the zones in relation to a bath tub.</p>
        <p>Figures 1.1c, d and h show the zones in relation to a shower.</p>
        <p>Figures 1.1e and f show the zones in relation to a shower without a basin from a fixed
          water outlet (shower head). Demountable shower heads are not considered and therefore do
          not alter the extent of the zone.</p>
        <p>Horizontal or inclined ceilings, walls with or without windows, doors, floors and fixed
          partitions may be taken into account where these effectively limit the extent of locations
          containing a bath or shower as well as their zones.</p>
        <p>Examples of the zones for a bath or shower are shown in Figures 1.1a–h.</p>
