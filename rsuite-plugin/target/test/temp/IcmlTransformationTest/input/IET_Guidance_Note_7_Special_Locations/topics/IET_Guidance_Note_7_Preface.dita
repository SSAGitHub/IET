  <title>Preface</title>
  <body>
    <p>This Guidance Note is part of a series issued by the Institution of Engineering and
      Technology to explain and enlarge upon the requirements in BS 7671:2008, the 17th
      Edition of the IET Wiring Regulations, incorporating Amendment No 1:2011.</p>
    <p>Note that this Guidance Note does not ensure compliance with BS 7671. It is intended
      to explain some of the requirements of BS 7671, but readers should always consult
      BS 7671 to satisfy themselves of compliance.</p>
    <p>The scope generally follows that of BS 7671; the relevant Regulations and Appendices
      are noted in the margin. Some Guidance Notes also contain material not included in
      BS 7671:2008 but which was included in earlier editions of the Wiring Regulations.
      All of the Guidance Notes contain references to other relevant sources of information.</p>
    <p>Electrical installations in the United Kingdom that comply with BS 7671 are likely to
      satisfy Statutory Regulations such as the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989, however
      this cannot be guaranteed. It is stressed that it is essential to establish which Statutory
      and other Regulations apply and to install accordingly. For example, an installation in
      premises subject to licensing may have requirements different from, or additional to,
      BS 7671 and these will take precedence.</p>
