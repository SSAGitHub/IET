The template files are for reference only and are not used in the deployment.

Copy the template file e.g. xxxxxxx.properties.template to xxxxxx.properties or xxxxxxx.cmd.template to xxxxxxx.cmd

Edit the properties file with the required values. These will be deployed to the target folder and will not be refreshed from GitHub.
