The template files are for reference only and are not used in the deployment.

Copy the template file e.g. xxxxxx.cmd.template to xxxxxx.cmd or xxxxxx.properties.template to xxxxxx.properties

Edit the cmd file with the required values. These will be deployed to the target folder and will not be refreshed from GitHub.
