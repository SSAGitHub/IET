            <title>Instructions to contributors</title>
            <p><italic>IET Power Electronics</italic> is published 12 times a year by the Institution of Engineering
                and Technology. All papers are subject to rigorous peer review and the decision to
                publish is based on the reviewers' comments. Papers should include a comprehensive,
                up-to-date literature review and the experimental results presented should
                demonstrate a significant advance over the current state of the art.</p>
